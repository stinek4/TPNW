<em>The States Parties to this Treaty, <em> Determined to contribute to the realization of the purposes and principles of\n    the Charter of the United Nations,\n    Deeply concerned about the catastrophic humanitarian consequences that\n    would result from any use of nuclear weapons, and recognizing the consequent need\n    to completely eliminate such weapons, which remains the only way to guarantee\n    that nuclear weapons are never used again under any circumstances,\n    Mindful of the risks posed by the continued existence of nuclear weapons,\n    including from any nuclear-weapon detonation by accident, miscalculation or\n    design, and emphasizing that these risks concern the security of all humanity, and\n    that all States share the responsibility to prevent any use of nuclear weapons,\n    Cognizant that the catastrophic consequences of nuclear weapons cannot be\n    adequately addressed, transcend national borders, pose grave implications for\n    human survival, the environment, socioeconomic development, the global economy,\n    food security and the health of current and future generations, and have a\n    disproportionate impact on women and girls, including as a result of ionizing\n    radiation,\n    Acknowledging the ethical imperatives for nuclear disarmament and the\n    urgency of achieving and maintaining a nuclear-weapon-free world, which is a\n    global public good of the highest order, serving both national and collective\n    security interests,\n    Mindful of the unacceptable suffering of and harm caused to the victims of\n    the use of nuclear weapons (hibakusha), as well as of those affected by the testing\n    of nuclear weapons,\n    Recognizing the disproportionate impact of nuclear-weapon activities on\n    indigenous peoples,\n    Reaffirming the need for all States at all times to comply with applicable\n    international law, including international humanitarian law and international human\n    rights law,\n    Basing themselves on the principles and rules of international humanitarian\n    law, in particular the principle that the right of parties to an armed conflict to choose\n    methods or means of warfare is not unlimited, the rule of distinction, the prohibition\n    against indiscriminate attacks, the rules on proportionality and precautions in attack,\n    the prohibition on the use of weapons of a nature to cause superfluous injury or\n    unnecessary suffering, and the rules for the protection of the natural environment, \n    Considering that any use of nuclear weapons would be contrary to the rules\n    of international law applicable in armed conflict, in particular the principles and\n    rules of international humanitarian law,\n    Reaffirming that any use of nuclear weapons would also be abhorrent to the\n    principles of humanity and the dictates of public conscience,\n    Recalling that, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, States\n    must refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the\n    territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner\n    inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations, and that the establishment and\n    maintenance of international peace and security are to be promoted with the least\n    diversion for armaments of the world\u2019s human and economic resources,\n    Recalling also the first resolution of the General Assembly of the United\n    Nations, adopted on 24 January 1946, and subsequent resolutions which call for the\n    elimination of nuclear weapons,\n    Concerned by the slow pace of nuclear disarmament, the continued reliance\n    on nuclear weapons in military and security concepts, doctrines and policies, and\n    the waste of economic and human resources on programmes for the production,\n    maintenance and modernization of nuclear weapons,\n    Recognizing that a legally binding prohibition of nuclear weapons constitutes\n    an important contribution towards the achievement and maintenance of a world free\n    of nuclear weapons, including the irreversible, verifiable and transparent\n    elimination of nuclear weapons, and determined to act towards that end,\n    Determined to act with a view to achieving effective progress towards\n    general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control,\n    Reaffirming that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring\n    to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under\n    strict and effective international control,\n    Reaffirming also that the full and effective implementation of the Treaty on\n    the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which serves as the cornerstone of the\n    nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime, has a vital role to play in\n    promoting international peace and security,\n    Recognizing the vital importance of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\n    Treaty and its verification regime as a core element of the nuclear disarmament and\n    non-proliferation regime,\n    Reaffirming the conviction that the establishment of the internationally\n    recognized nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of arrangements freely arrived\n    at among the States of the region concerned enhances global and regional peace and\n    security, strengthens the nuclear non-proliferation regime and contributes towards\n    realizing the objective of nuclear disarmament,\n    Emphasizing that nothing in this Treaty shall be interpreted as affecting the\n    inalienable right of its States Parties to develop research, production and use of\n    nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination,\n    Recognizing that the equal, full and effective participation of both women\n    and men is an essential factor for the promotion and attainment of sustainable peace\n    and security, and committed to supporting and strengthening the effective\n    participation of women in nuclear disarmament,\n    Recognizing also the importance of peace and disarmament education in all\n    its aspects and of raising awareness of the risks and consequences of nuclear\n    weapons for current and future generations, and committed to the dissemination of\n    the principles and norms of this Treaty,\n    Stressing the role of public conscience in the furthering of the principles of\n    humanity as evidenced by the call for the total elimination of nuclear weapons, and\n    recognizing the efforts to that end undertaken by the United Nations, the\n    International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, other international and\n    regional organizations, non-governmental organizations, religious leaders,\n    parliamentarians, academics and the hibakusha,\n    Have agreed as follows:"},{article:"Article
